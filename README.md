# ICD-10 codes in serbian

It's just a csv with all the ICD-10 codes with serbian and latin descriptions. The format is as follows

code|description_serbian|description_latin
A00|Kolera NOVA|Cholera
A00.0|Kolera, uzročnik Vibrio cholerae 01,biotip cholerae|Cholera classica
etc.

Couldn't find it anywhere available, so I made it.

No licenses or guarantees, but I would be glad to hear if you used it in an interesting medical project, at info _at_ drpandurevic.com

Enjoy.
